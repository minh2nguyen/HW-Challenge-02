# MinhThu's Professional Portfolio
## HW Challenge 02

## Description:

I have created a professional portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. The protfolio is meant to grow with me overtime, and will highlight my strongest work. This is what I have created with the knowledge that I have gained thus far, while keeping the following requirements in mind:

    - Including a recent avatar of myself.

    - Including functioning navagation links: About me, My work, & Contact info.

    - Dividing my sites into several sections: About me, My work, and Contact info. 

    - Creating UI scrolls to the corresponding sections. 

    - Including projects that link to the deploy application. 

    - Including hover effects for various links. 

    - Making sure my page resizes to various screens. 

    - Being creative and having fun by adding my own personal flair. 

I plan on adding more projects, a resume, linkedin, and editing this profile as I continue to learn more throughout my bootcamp experience.
