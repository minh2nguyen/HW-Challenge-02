# MinhThu's Professional Portfolio
## HW Challenge 02

I have created a professional portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. The protfolio is meant to grow with me overtime, and will highlight my strongest work. This is what I have created with the knowledge that I have gained thus far, while keeping the following requirements in mind:

    - including a recent avatar of myself.

    - including functioning navagation links: About me, My work, & Contact info.

    - Dividing my sites into several sections: About me, My work, and Contact info. 

    - Creating UI scrolls to the corresponding sections.
